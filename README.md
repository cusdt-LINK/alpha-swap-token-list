## How to get your token LOGO on AlphaSwap:

### 1. Image for the Token Logo <a id="1-image-for-the-token-logo"></a>

> * **File Extension**: `png` . Uppercase `PNG` is considered invalid
> * **File Name**：`logo.png`
> * **Size**: `256px by 256px`
> * **Background**: Preferably transparent

### 2. Token Information File <a id="2-token-information-file"></a>

> * **File Extension**: `json` . Uppercase `JSON` is considered invalid
> * **File Name**：`myToken.json`

The sample below shows what information has to be included on the `myToken.json` file.  
Please make sure that the details are accurate and follows the formatting.  
The contract address should follow the checksum address format \(see next requirement\).

```
